# RobotProject

This repository contains the first integrative project at **Polytechnique Montr√©al** for the **Software and Computer Engineering Department (GIGL)**.  

The project consists of the **software development of a robot**, developed in a team of four students, based on an **ATmega324 microcontroller board**. 

During the **Winter 2025 semester**, we studied all the main components of the robot, including its wheels, various sensors, and memory. This knowledge was then applied to design and implement a complete robot system.  

The project culminated in an **obstacle course challenge** at the end of the semester, where the robot had to autonomously navigate through a predefined track.  


For more information, such as photos of the robot, details about the materials, and additional resources, please refer to the course website: https://cours.polymtl.ca/inf1900/intro/.
